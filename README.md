This is the front-end for Outside Box. Have you have ever been on the phone call with someone who asks for your email address, mailing address, or credit card number. Unless you are trained in the NATO phonetic alphabet, verbally communicating critical information over the phone can be really difficult. Outside Box makes it easy to communicate accurate information in a secure way over the phone.
